# Logan Bunch

Father, husband, son, brother, I hit all those boxes. I remember leaving high school having no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I had been accepted to to a state university but I ultimately opted not to go, because I had no direction. At this point in my life, I can't say for sure if that was a good decision or not. It's certain my life would have been drastically different, but for better or worse it is impossible to know. I continued to work at Applebee's and I attended a handful of courses at my community college.

Skip a few beats and I'm here with a wife, two kids, a house, and a career in quality assurance at a food manufacturer. I'm over a decade out of high school and I can now confidently say that I am only slightly more sure about what I want to do with my life.

I like money, rather, I like buying things, and I like having my bills paid. I'm not sure if writing code will provide that for me, but I do know that when I am staring into this laptop screen writing code that may or may not work, I'm happy.
